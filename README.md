# GradPlan

## Plan out the courses in your major

### Project Description
This will be a web app that students can use to form a graduation plan. They will be able to create a profile, select their major, and then select from the required classes in the major and form a 4-5 year graduation map.

### Team
I'm looking for one other to join the team

### SQL
MySQL is the relational database management system of choice

### NoSQL
We are planning to use DynamoDB to easily scale

### Business
This will be a free service for BYU students to define a graduation plan and maximize course efficiency.

We plan to develop a MVP, and then take that proof of concept to BYU to integrate into existing student services.

### Legal
Could possibly be violating a dozen school rules, but 300 points to Gryffindor

### Technical
Our priorities will be:

1. Choose an initial SQL database for a prototype
2. Choose both client-side and server-side programming languages/frameworks
3. Implement an MVP
4. Implement Dynamo DB to scale
